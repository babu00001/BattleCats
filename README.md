# Battle Cats

This project is a game model that reproduces the mobile game 'Nyangko War' using a conveyor belt, camera, and cat-shaped coins. 


# Step1. Conceptual design

1. Basic Function
- The enemies of the main character Nyangko gather and approach on a conveyor belt.
- The protagonist, upon sensing the approaching enemies through the camera mounted above their head, defeats the enemies by swinging their tongue at them.

2. How to design
- Design the conveyor belt unit and the main character, Nyangko.
- Use a 3D printer to create the respective parts.
- Assemble the stepper motor for conveyor belt operation.
- Design and assemble the parts to enable the main character, Nyangko, to defeat enemies by operating its tongue using a stepper motor.
- Finally, attach the camera to the forehead of the main character, Nyangko.

# Step2. Working Princple

- Sub Function 1) Design it to be similar to the game 'Nyangko War' (made by 3D Printer)
- Sub Function 2) Attach motors and mechanical components, and connect wiring to each module.
- Sub Function 3) Check if the motors and cameras are functioning properly.


# Step3. Make RaspberryPi_circuit

#Components
- RaspberryPi 4 B (RAM 2GB)
- RaspberryPi Camera Module V1 (RPi Camera V1)
- 28BYJ-48 (Step Motor)
- ULN2003(Step Motor Driver)
- Here is sample code. According to operation and circuit diagram, you have to modify code!

# Step4. Make it!!
